    # by chaining calls to resources, terminated with a method linked to an
    # action that will execute the api call.
    #
    # For example:
    #
    # `foo.stories(story_id).comments.update(id: comment_id, text: "comment text")`
    #
    # This example will execute a call to:
    #
    # `https://api.app.shortcut.com/api/v3/stories/{story-id}/comments/{comment-id}`
    #
    # with arguments:
    #
    #   `{ text: "comment text" }`
